# Yolahboy Core
A Gameboy Emulator library, written in C by me. This was written as a programming exercise, right now it is not cycle accurate, there are some rendering bugs, and the audio is buggy and incomplete.

If you want to use this display from gpu.framebuffer when gpu.should_draw == true and push audio from apu.buffer when apu.buffer_full == true.
